Our computer experience dates back over 30 years with the acquisition of the first Sodick CNC EDM machine in North America in 1983. Since then, we have upgraded to nine Sodick machines thereby continually advancing our technology to provide excellent service.`;

Our toolmaking and drawing interpretation skills, coupled with many years of CAD/CAM experience, give us an edge in tackling complex projects. In addition to our EDM facilities, we have in-house milling, grinding, and wire “EDM-ing” where electrodes and other tooling/fixtures are manufactured.`;
